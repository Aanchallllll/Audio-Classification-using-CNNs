This image illustrates the process of classifying noise from audio data. The audio signals are first converted into spectrograms, which are visual representations of the sound frequencies over time. These spectrograms are then fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the noise into categories such as "school," "generator," or "community radio."
